# Final_Project_AI_Julius
This is my final project in my Artificial Intelligence class illustrating and prediction of a regression problem.

## Abstract
This project aims to use the UCI White Wine Quality dataset to estimate the target value of the alcohol content just from its multiple measurements from the dataset such as pH, acidity, and density. Additionally, the project shows multiple supervised regression models being tested and compared. Out of all of the regression models, the Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LightGBM) proved to be the best in generalization with its metrics. For example, the RMSE = 0.3304, the MSE = 0.1098, and the R2 = 0.9265. All of these values provided more validation that a complex model is well suited to predict the alcohol content for the dataset.
